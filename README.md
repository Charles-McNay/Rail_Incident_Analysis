# Railroad Freight Incident Analysis



##  ABOUT

The purpose of this project is to analyze the rate of incidents in the rail transported freight industry.

Freight train derailments are far more common than the general public is aware of and generally only gain media attention if the derailment affects a large number of people.[^1]

The Association of American Railroads claim that 99.9% of hazardous material reaches it's destination without incident.[^2] 


- More than 3.1 billion tons of hazmat transported in the US every year.[^3] Over 80% of all hazmat shipments are by rail.[^4]
- There is no regulation for crew size on freight trains some non-Class I railroads have long operated with just one person in the locomotive cab.[^5] 
- In 1977 train crews consisted of 4 people[^6] 
- Freight trains averaged a lenght of less than 4000 feet in the late 1970's[^7]
- Today Freight trains average 6,800 feet[^8]
- A train can weigh anywhere from 8,818,490 lbs to 44,092,452 lbs or even more under some particular instances.[^9]

I will be looking into the differences between incidents with larger crews and smaller trains and larger trains with smaller crews.

**What I'm asking**

* Is there a corelation between crew size and incidents?
* How often do hazmat cars release material in incidents?
* Are larger trains more likely to derail?
* How many lives have been lost to rail incidents in the past 40 years?
* How much property damage has rail related incidents caused?
